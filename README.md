# Raid-Simulator-Temporary-Version
Raid Simulator is a simulator predicting a Survival, "Dps" and "Hps" using a data from [warcraftlogs.com](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/) written in Unity, project used to self-learning. Finished project is builded in WebGL version. 
This is my very first project, code is heavly nested and needs a lot of refactorization. I wrote it when i had no idea how to properly manage code and transfer data properly between functions.

THIS IS NOT FINISHED VERSION OF A PROJECT, A LOT OF FEATURES ARE MISSING.

## Important Note
Resolution is messed up, to see this program properly, you need to open it in fullscreen mode.

## Scripts location
All scripts are located in "Assets/Scripts" folder
